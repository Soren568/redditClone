# NOTES DURING CODING:
 - Using Session/Cookies for authentication
 - Use Argon2 for password hashing instead of Bcrypt
 - Use TypeORM for relational mapping
 - Redis for its speed: use connect-redis library
 - URQL, GraphQL Code Generator
 - SSR with URQL and GraphQL
    - need to setup a separate package (next-urql for )
    - withUrqlClient lets us decide which pages use SSR by optionally wrapping components
    - SSR optimizes SEO because in client side rendering the javascript is not updated on content load for google crawling
    - SSR only necessary for pages where queries are happening and then where the content will optimize SEO or not
 - Use NodeMailer to handle forgot password (sends email to user)
 - uuid + ioredis creates and stores a unique id to send for password reset email
